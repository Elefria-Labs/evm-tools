title: Build a Web3 notes app in 4 steps?
description: 'In this article we will be creating a notes app using IPFS. IPFS is a decentralized storage.'
date: Oct 8 2022

To create this app we will be using following tools-

- [zk-block](https://github.com/heypran/zk-block) - boilerplate for zk and web3 dapps. ( NextJS, React, Typescript, Metamask)
- [web3 storage](https://web3.storage) - library for IPFS and provides an easy and scalable way to store data on IPFS

We wont be diving into UI or ReactJs part of the app. As these are outside the scope of the article.

When dealing with any storage, there are mainly two tings that we need to deal with -

- Storing data
- Retrieving data

Assuming you can handle creating a UI and user inputs in react, we can just focus on the code that will help you interact with the IPFS using `web3.storage`.

### 1. Install the web3.storage

`npm install web3.storage`

### 2. You need to get an access token

Getting an access token is free, and you can get yours at https://web3.storage/account/.

### 3. Create a storage client object

```js
const storage = new Web3Storage({ token: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_KEY });
```

### 4. Store & Retrieve Files

### Storing

The Web3.Storage client's `put` method accepts an array of File objects. So, we will have to convert any data that we want to store in a `File` object.

```
const finalContent = JSON.stringify(content);
const file = new File([finalContent], await sha256(finalContent), {
      type: 'text/plain',
    });
```

Once, we have the `File` object. we can simply call `put` to store or upload the files to IPFS

```js
const cid = await storage.put([file]);
```

CID you get back from the client when uploading is the CID of the directory and not the file itself.

To link to the file itself using an IPFS URI, just add the filename to the CID, separated by a `/` like this: `ipfs://<cid>/<filename>`.

For eg, to access this blog link stored on ipfs you can use the below link -

https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicbv3pjrmkx7vy27puybjitqibzo6r5hrlc2exp6jh4kf4ijhpaqe

---

<b>Optional:</b> put also provides callback functions to show upload progress.

```js
const onRootCidReady = (cid) => {
  console.log('uploading files with cid:', cid);
};

const onStoredChunk = (size) => {
  uploaded += size;
  const pct = totalSize / uploaded;
  console.log(`Uploading... ${pct.toFixed(2)}% complete`);
};

await storage.put(files, { onRootCidReady, onStoredChunk });
```

---

### Retrieving

You can retrieve your uploaded data by -

`https://<cid>.ipfs.dweb.link/`

`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>`

or via code

```js
const web3ResponseObject = await storage.get(cid); // Web3Response object
```

The `web3ResponseObject` extends the Response object from the Web [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) with two methods that provide access to the retrieved IPFS data: `files` and `unixFsIterator()`.

The `files` method returns an array of `Web3File` objects, which represent all files contained in the content archive identified by the given CID. A `Web3File` is just like a regular web `File` object, with the addition of `path` and `cid` properties. These contain the relative path of the file within the archive and the CID of the file, respectively.

```js
const files = await web3ResponseObject.files(); // return your files
```

You can checkout the notes app in action [here](https://github.com/heypran/dotes)

**_Optional:_** Encrypting the data

Since, all the data is publicly accessible and sometimes its best to store data in encrypted form.

```js
const stringifiedContent = JSON.stringify(content);
const finalContent = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
  stringifiedContent,
  password,
).toString();
```

and you can decrypt like below,

```js
const retrievedContent = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(reader.result, password).toString(
  CryptoJS.enc.Utf8,
);
const actualContent = JSON.parse(retrievedContent);
```

That's all!
