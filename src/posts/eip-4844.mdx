title: What is coming up with EIP-4844? Scalability, Data sharding?
description: 'Eip 4844 introduces a new tx type for blob-carrying transactions. The blob will not be accessible by EVM but only its commitment will be accessible'

- EIP-4844 proposes a new type of transaction for Ethereum that allows for the storage of small pieces of data, called "blobs," in the beacon node for a short period of time.
- These changes are designed to be compatible with Ethereum's future plans to scale the network, and the size of the blobs is manageable enough to avoid excessive disk usage. In simpler terms, this change allows for more efficient storage of data in the Ethereum network, which is important for its long-term growth and usability.
