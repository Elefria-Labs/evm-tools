title: Relation Between Solidity Events, Topics & Logs

## Topics

---

Topics are indexed parameters to an event.
`topic[0]` always refers to the hash of the hash of the event itself, and can have up to 3 indexed arguments, which will be reflected in the topics.

## Logs

---

EVM uses low-level primitives called logs to map them to high-level solidity construct called Event. Logs may contain different topics that are indexed arguments.

#### Example:

Consider Event:

```js
 event GroupCreated(uint indexed groupId, uint itemCount);
```

and you emit the above event inside `createGroup` function:

```js
 function createGroup() {
        emit GroupCreated(12, 23);
  }

```

This will create a low-level EVM log entry with topics

`0x123....abc` (Keccak-256 hash of GroupCreated(uint256,uint256))

`0x4238....gef` (Keccak-256 hash of groupId), value 12

You'll notice that `itemCount` will not be a topic, but it will be included in the data section of the event.

Now, in the web3 client you may watch for creation events of `groups` with `groupId` 12 Or you can also filter all past events in similar way (refer below):

```js
const event = myContract.GroupCreated({ groupId: 12 });
event.watch(function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Found ', result);
});
```
