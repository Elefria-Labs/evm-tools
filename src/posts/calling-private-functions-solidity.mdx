`internal` is the default visibility level for state variables.

`private` state variables are like internal ones but they are not visible in derived contracts.

A `private` or `internal` function can only be called by the contract itself.

### How does the EVM enforce this?

On the EVM level, there are no function calls. Rather, solidity generates a dispatcher for each contract, and sending a transaction just activates said dispatcher. On a theoretical level, making a function private is just a matter of not putting it in the dispatcher.
