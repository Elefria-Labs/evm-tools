title: Libraries in solidity

Libraries in solidity are considered stateless, and hence have the following restrictions:

- They do not have any storage (so can’t have non-constant state variables)
- They can’t hold ethers (so can’t have a fallback function)
- Doesn’t allow payable functions (since they can’t hold ethers)
- Cannot inherit nor be inherited
- Can’t be destroyed (no selfdestruct() function since version 0.4.20)

There are 2 types of libraries: **deployed & embedded**

### Deployed libraries

These have their own address, and they can be used by several other smart contracts.
If a library contain public or external functions then library needs to be deployed. The deployment of library will generate a unique address in the blockchain. This address needs to be linked with calling contract.

### Embedded libraries

These don’t have their own address and are deployed as part of the code of the smart contract that use them.
If a smart contract is consuming a library which have only internal functions, then the EVM simply embeds library into the contract. Instead of using delegate call to call a function, it simply uses JUMP statement(normal method call). There is no need to separately deploy library in this scenario.

```js

// Embedded (function is internal)
library Lib {
  function add(uint a, uint b) pure internal returns(uint) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

//  Deployed (function is public)
library Lib {
  function add(uint a, uint b) pure public returns(uint) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

contract Example {

    using Lib for uint;

    function addExample(uint _a, uint _b) public view returns (uint) {
        return _a.add(_b);
    }
}

```
