- Pack struct variables
- Organize storage variables to fit them 256 bit/32 bytes slots. But remember to use them together in a function otherwise, SLOAD 2100 gas will be charged multiple times, there will be no benefit of HOT load from storage.
- Use Immutable and constants ( constants are stored as part of byte code)
- When deploying multiple contracts as clones use minimal proxy pattern
- Use calldata & memory where possible
- Use `unchecked {}` when you are sure there is no overflow or underflow
- Use custom `error()` instead of require or revert when possible
- When you use require use smaller message lengths
- Use events to eliminate the need for storage variables
- Use `++number` to increment
- Store data in memory which needs to be read frequently, such as array.length
