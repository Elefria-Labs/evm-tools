title: Using Arrays Within Solidity Structs

`memory` variables are temporary variables that exist only inside the calling function. The memory variables do not persist and are generally cheaper to use than storage variables.

`storage` variables are stored in contract state and are only changed by sending a transaction and spending gas.

```js

pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract ArrayInsideStruct {

  event CreateGame(address indexed _from, uint256 _value);

  struct Game {
    address[] users;
    uint256 gameId;
  }

  Game[] public games;

  function createGame() public {

      // initialize struct with empty new array of size 0
      Game memory game = Game(new address[](0), 0);

      games.push(game);

      // push data to the array inside struct
      games[games.length-1].users.push(msg.sender);

      CreateGame(msg.sender, games.length-1);
  }
  function getUsers(uint i) public view returns (address[]){
      return game[i].users;
  }
}
```
