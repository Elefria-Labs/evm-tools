title: View and Pure Functions in Solidity

`view` indicates that the function will not alter the storage state in any way. But it allows you to read the state.

`pure` is even more strict, indicating that it will not even read the storage state.

A pure function is a function which given the same input, always returns the same output. But the state of the contract keeps changing as users interact with it. So if you pass a state variable as an argument to the function, since the state is changing, that function will not be pure. That's why pure functions cannot access to state.

```js


// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

contract ViewAndPure {
    uint public gamePoints = 0;


    // No modification or reading from the state
    function checkRewards(uint multiplier, uint points) public pure returns (uint) {
        return multiplier * points;
    }

    // No modification but can read from the state
    function addGamePoints(uint newScore) public view returns (uint) {
        return gamePoints + newScore;
    }

}

```

> If you call `view` or `pure` functions externally, you do not pay a gas fee.
