Let's dive into the fee growth mechanism in Uniswap V3.

1. Global Fee Accumulation:

Every time a swap occurs, fees are collected and added to the global fee accumulation variables:

```solidity
// In Pool.sol
struct PoolState {
    // ... other fields ...
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128;
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128;
}

function _updateFeeGrowthGlobal(uint256 feeAmount, uint256 tokenAmount, uint128 liquidity) private {
    if (liquidity > 0) {
        feeGrowthGlobal0X128 += FullMath.mulDiv(feeAmount, FixedPoint128.Q128, liquidity);
    }
}
```

2. Tick-Level Fee Tracking:

Fees are also tracked at each tick to handle concentrated liquidity:

```solidity
// In Tick.sol
struct Info {
    // ... other fields ...
    uint256 feeGrowthOutside0X128;
    uint256 feeGrowthOutside1X128;
}

function update(
    mapping(int24 => Tick.Info) storage self,
    int24 tick,
    int24 currentTick,
    uint128 liquidityDelta,
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128,
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128,
    bool upper
) internal returns (bool flipped) {
    Tick.Info storage info = self[tick];
    uint128 liquidityBefore = info.liquidityGross;
    uint128 liquidityAfter = LiquidityMath.addDelta(liquidityBefore, liquidityDelta);

    if (liquidityBefore == 0) {
        // initialize tick
        info.feeGrowthOutside0X128 = feeGrowthGlobal0X128;
        info.feeGrowthOutside1X128 = feeGrowthGlobal1X128;
    }

    // ... more logic ...
}
```

3. Position-Level Fee Tracking:

For each liquidity position, we track the last recorded fee growth:

```solidity
// In Position.sol
struct Info {
    uint128 liquidity;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128;
    uint128 tokensOwed0;
    uint128 tokensOwed1;
}
```

4. Fee Calculation for a Position:

When a position is modified or closed, we calculate the fees owed:

```solidity
function _updatePosition(
    address owner,
    int24 tickLower,
    int24 tickUpper,
    int128 liquidityDelta,
    int24 tick
) internal returns (Position.Info storage position) {
    position = positions.get(owner, tickLower, tickUpper);

    uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128;

    (feeGrowthInside0X128, feeGrowthInside1X128) = ticks.getFeeGrowthInside(
        tickLower,
        tickUpper,
        tick,
        feeGrowthGlobal0X128,
        feeGrowthGlobal1X128
    );

    position.tokensOwed0 += uint128(
        FullMath.mulDiv(
            feeGrowthInside0X128 - position.feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
            position.liquidity,
            FixedPoint128.Q128
        )
    );
    position.tokensOwed1 += uint128(
        FullMath.mulDiv(
            feeGrowthInside1X128 - position.feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
            position.liquidity,
            FixedPoint128.Q128
        )
    );

    position.feeGrowthInside0LastX128 = feeGrowthInside0X128;
    position.feeGrowthInside1LastX128 = feeGrowthInside1X128;

    // ... more logic ...
}
```

5. Fee Growth Inside Ticks:

The `getFeeGrowthInside` function calculates the fee growth inside a specific range:

```solidity
function getFeeGrowthInside(
    mapping(int24 => Tick.Info) storage self,
    int24 tickLower,
    int24 tickUpper,
    int24 tickCurrent,
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128,
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128
) internal view returns (uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128) {
    Tick.Info storage lower = self[tickLower];
    Tick.Info storage upper = self[tickUpper];

    // ... calculate feeGrowthBelow0X128, feeGrowthBelow1X128, feeGrowthAbove0X128, feeGrowthAbove1X128

    feeGrowthInside0X128 = feeGrowthGlobal0X128 - feeGrowthBelow0X128 - feeGrowthAbove0X128;
    feeGrowthInside1X128 = feeGrowthGlobal1X128 - feeGrowthBelow1X128 - feeGrowthAbove1X128;
}
```

This mechanism ensures that:

1. Fees are accumulated globally for the entire pool.
2. Each tick keeps track of fees accumulated outside its range.
3. Each position can calculate its earned fees based on its liquidity and the fee growth inside its price range.
4. Liquidity providers only earn fees when the current price is within their specified range.

### What is the difference between feeGrowthOutside0X128 and feeGrowthInside0X128

Excellent question. The distinction between `feeGrowthOutside0X128` and `feeGrowthInside0X128` is crucial for understanding how Uniswap V3 tracks and distributes fees accurately within specific price ranges. Let's break this down:

1. `feeGrowthOutside0X128`:

- This is stored at the tick level (in the `Tick.Info` struct).
- It represents the cumulative fee growth per unit of liquidity that has occurred outside of this tick.
- "Outside" means either above the upper tick or below the lower tick of a position, depending on the current price.
- It's used to calculate the fee growth inside a range by subtracting it from the global fee growth.

2. `feeGrowthInside0X128`:

- This is not directly stored but calculated when needed.
- It represents the cumulative fee growth per unit of liquidity that has occurred inside a specific range (between two ticks).
- It's computed using the global fee growth and the outside fee growth of the lower and upper ticks of a position.

Here's how they relate:

```solidity
function getFeeGrowthInside(
    mapping(int24 => Tick.Info) storage self,
    int24 tickLower,
    int24 tickUpper,
    int24 tickCurrent,
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128,
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128
) internal view returns (uint256 feeGrowthInside0X128, uint256 feeGrowthInside1X128) {
    Tick.Info storage lower = self[tickLower];
    Tick.Info storage upper = self[tickUpper];

    uint256 feeGrowthBelow0X128;
    uint256 feeGrowthBelow1X128;
    if (tickCurrent >= tickLower) {
        feeGrowthBelow0X128 = lower.feeGrowthOutside0X128;
        feeGrowthBelow1X128 = lower.feeGrowthOutside1X128;
    } else {
        feeGrowthBelow0X128 = feeGrowthGlobal0X128 - lower.feeGrowthOutside0X128;
        feeGrowthBelow1X128 = feeGrowthGlobal1X128 - lower.feeGrowthOutside1X128;
    }

    uint256 feeGrowthAbove0X128;
    uint256 feeGrowthAbove1X128;
    if (tickCurrent < tickUpper) {
        feeGrowthAbove0X128 = upper.feeGrowthOutside0X128;
        feeGrowthAbove1X128 = upper.feeGrowthOutside1X128;
    } else {
        feeGrowthAbove0X128 = feeGrowthGlobal0X128 - upper.feeGrowthOutside0X128;
        feeGrowthAbove1X128 = feeGrowthGlobal1X128 - upper.feeGrowthOutside1X128;
    }

    feeGrowthInside0X128 = feeGrowthGlobal0X128 - feeGrowthBelow0X128 - feeGrowthAbove0X128;
    feeGrowthInside1X128 = feeGrowthGlobal1X128 - feeGrowthBelow1X128 - feeGrowthAbove1X128;
}
```

Key points:

1. `feeGrowthOutside0X128` is used to calculate `feeGrowthInside0X128`.
2. The calculation depends on the current tick relative to the range's lower and upper ticks.
3. `feeGrowthInside0X128` is essentially what's left of the global fee growth after subtracting the fee growth outside the range.

This mechanism allows Uniswap V3 to efficiently track fees for any arbitrary price range, enabling the concentrated liquidity feature while ensuring accurate fee distribution to liquidity providers.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this calculation is used in practice, or do you have any other questions about this distinction?
