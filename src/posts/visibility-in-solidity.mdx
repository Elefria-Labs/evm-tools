title: Visibility in Solidity
description: 'Functions and state variables have to declare whether they are accessible by other contracts or externally.'

Functions can be declared as

| Visibility | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `public`   | Any contract and account can call                                  |
| `private`  | Accessible only inside the contract that defines the function      |
| `internal` | Accessible only inside contract that inherits an internal function |
| `external` | Accessible only other contracts and accounts can call              |

State variables can be declared as public, private, or internal but not external.

pragma solidity ^0.8.15;

contract ViewAndPure {
    uint public gamePoints = 0;


    // No modification or reading from the state
    function checkRewards(uint multiplier, uint points) public pure returns (uint) {
        return multiplier * points;
    }

    // No modification but can read from the state
    function addGamePoints(uint newScore) public view returns (uint) {
        return gamePoints + newScore;
    }

}

```

> If you call `view` or `pure` functions externally, you do not pay a gas fee.
